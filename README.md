# MedicationReminder
#### Data Structures Group Project

**Project Title:** Medication Reminder

**Creators:** John Hattas and Nathan Lang

## Project Description

The foundation of the project is a system of interactive times and reminders targeted at those, who take large amounts of medication at infrequent intervals through the day. The times are designed to interactively remind the user to do whatever the timer is set for, refusing to move along to the next timer until the user responds with an affirmative that the reminder was not only seen but completed. This is an extremely practical project for a huge portion of the population. It is different to most/all timers on the market due to its ability to question the user and make decisions based on the received input and not blindly move along to the next timer.

## Original Project Conception

A teenager living with Cystic Fibrosis, has to take large amounts of medication their entire life. Daily having to do nebulizers, physical treatments, inhalers, pills, and antibiotics, some even need to eat every two hours or risk succumbing to a coma from lack of blood sugar. Keeping track of these many medications, the times they need to be taken at, and remembering if the time you took that was actually today or yesterday is - even for someone in their prime -   a massive challenge, one that they struggle with every day. The elderly and those with mental disabilities struggle even more than that, and often their medication is even more important.

Anyone who has taken large amounts of medication for a long period of time is painfully aware of how ineffective normal timers and alarms are in the best of circumstances, they know even better how ineffective they are if you are distracted.

This application should track the time of day that each medication was taken at and log all of this information in a database (or file or a serialized object) that the user could access.

## Logistics

Team size for the projects should be two to three at most. Follow the key dates and deliverable described below. Submit the interim reports to d2l.

## Technology

Java FX/Java Swing/Java Web Application or any programming language of the team’s choice.

## Key Dates and Deliverables

#### Market Research and Mockup Design (Nov.10th)

Conduct market research of relevant products such as mobile apps or web applications that do similar things as the project. Survey the competition designs, and include the report of what is available out there and what features you can realistically implement by the end of this semester. Also, use a professional mock up generator to create sample mock-ups of your final project (see Useful Links section below).

#### GUI Design with some features (Nov.20th)

Write basic prototype of the application that displays the GUI. Either hard code the inputs such as medication history, reminders, etc or read them from a file and display on the GUI.
